Thus \"domain expertise\" is not really applicable here, although we could of course talk to a avian zoologist specialized in storks, that would likely confirm this. However, if we were to take this seriously from a data perspective, we would collect variables, such as:\n",

    "By conditioning on these variables (e.g., in regression or stratification) or using propensity scores (estimating the likelihood of “high stork population” given habitat/socioeconomic features), we could isolate any direct effect of storks on birth rates (which would extremely unlikely to be non-zero if we do it right).\n",
